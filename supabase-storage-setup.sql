/*
IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. File Path Structure:
   - organisations/{organisation_id}/properties/{property_id}/{category}/{filename}
   - organisations/{organisation_id}/general/{category}/{filename}

2. RLS Policies Work By:
   - Extracting organisation_id from the file path
   - Checking user_permissions table for access rights
   - Ensuring user has appropriate permissions for the organisation

3. Security Features:
   - Files are only accessible to users with proper permissions
   - Upload restrictions based on user permissions
   - Organisation-based isolation
   - File type restrictions
   - File size limits

4. To Test:
   - Try uploading a file through your API
   - Verify only authorised users can access files
   - Check that file paths follow the expected structure

5. Troubleshooting:
   - If policies don't work, check that user_permissions table exists
   - Verify that auth.uid() returns the correct user ID
   - Ensure file paths follow the expected structure
