-- NOTES
-- =====================================================

/*
IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. Updated File Path Structure:
   - NEW: {organisation_id}/organisation/{category}/{filename}
   - NEW: {organisation_id}/properties/{property_id}/{category}/{filename}
   - OLD: organisations/{organisation_id}/general/{category}/{filename}
   - OLD: organisations/{organisation_id}/properties/{property_id}/{category}/{filename}

2. RLS Policies Updated:
   - Changed from (string_to_array(name, '/'))[2] to (string_to_array(name, '/'))[1]
   - This extracts organisation_id from the first part of the path instead of second
   - Aligns with new structure without "organisations" prefix

3. Security Features:
   - Files are only accessible to users with proper permissions
   - Upload restrictions based on user permissions
   - Organisation-based isolation
   - File type restrictions
   - File size limits

4. To Test:
   - Try uploading a file through your API
   - Verify only authorised users can access files
   - Check that file paths follow the expected structure
   - Test both organisation and property document uploads

5. Migration Notes:
   - If you have existing files with old structure, you'll need to migrate them
   - Update any existing file references in your application
   - Test thoroughly after applying these changes

6. Troubleshooting:
   - If policies don't work, check that user_permissions table exists
   - Verify that auth.uid() returns the correct user ID
   - Ensure file paths follow the new expected structure
   - Check that organisation_id in user_permissions matches the path structure
